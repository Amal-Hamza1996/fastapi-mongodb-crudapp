In this repo, you will learn to develop Rest API using FAST API, Python and MongoDB.
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python 
type hints.

We will develop REST API using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, and respond data in JSON format with 
proper HTTP status codes.

We will connect MongoDB with our FastAPI application and perform the required CRUD operation.
